            <h6>Overview:</h6>
            <p>
                This research project contributed to the Robotics and Sensorimotor Control Lab’s efforts in improving our understanding of human somatosensory perception in their upper limbs. The overall project goal is to identify the reason for tactile perception deficits in individuals with stroke.
                My contribution to this project was to advance a proof-of-concept mechatronic device to one that could be used for pilot testing. The desired deliverables are the development of hardware and software to permit automated control of the mechanical stimuli applied to an individual’s fingertip.
                The system now includes, in addition to the actuator fabricated in the previous quarter, a pressure regulator, pressure sensor, PIC32-powered controller, and serial communication via a computer for automated control of and data collection from the device.
            </p>
            <h6>Scope:</h6>  
            <p>
                The scope of the project is to apply a tactile stimulus to an individual’s fingertip in an MRI environment. Requirements for the device include sufficient robustness and flexibility for travel between testing environments and future development. The pneumatic device consists of six (6) main components connected via polyurethane tubing and polypropylene connectors (for pneumatic output) and cables (for electrical control). An air supply capable of outputting at least 20 psi is also required. The system pipeline, as visualized in Figure 1.1.1 below, begins with a PIC32 microcontroller. This microcontroller controls the pressure regulator output in order to designate the receiving chamber of the actuator via a double solenoid. A Honeywell pressure sensor is incorporated in the path to the bottom chamber only for additional feedback on the accuracy of the pressure regulator output before the output pressure reaches the PTFE end-effector. Accurate control of the top chamber is not feasible due to air leaks through the opening for the piston, so there is no sensor or regulator connected to the top chamber.

            <h6>Technical Objectives:</h6>
            <p>
                The following requirements were placed on the project for the corresponding justifications:
            </p>

            <p>
                <code>MRI Compatibility</code> - The tactile stimulation will be analyzed using fMRI. The device and all connected components within the MRI room must be composed of non-magnetic materials. The strength of typical scanners, such as those used at the Northwestern University Center for Translational Imaging, range from 1.5T to 3T. Extreme caution is required with any conductive materials due to the potential dangers of the MRI unit, such as RF heating and the conversion of “normal” objects of magnetic material into projectiles.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>Robustness</code> - Due to the frequent travel between the Evanston and Chicago campuses required for testing, the revised design must be neatly containable with minimal assembly and disassembly required. All components should be securely soldered or utilize the proper dual in-line package (DIP/DIL) socket. Control should be executed through serial commands to limit hardware requirements and eliminate any unnecessary areas of potential failure as much as possible. Additionally, a custom case to protect the controller circuit must be designed and implemented.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>Automatability</code> - In order to streamline the testing procedure (and also to minimize the required hardware while still maintaining all controller capabilities), control of the system should be executed purely digitally through serial communication. This also ensures that all controls are clearly labeled and in one place to make control intuitive for all users, regardless of technical background.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following deliverables are required for the completion of this project:
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>Documentation</code> - Information in this report will serve as a manual for the device. Specifically, this manual will cover the design, assembly, and any notable limitations of the system. When appropriate, links to source files, CAD files, datasheets, and other supporting documents will be provided and cited. Rationales will also be provided for design decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>Fabrication</code> - Manufacture of the pneumatic cylinder, printed circuit board (PCB), controller case, hand interface, and all additional hardware components required must be completed and assembled so that the device is ready to use upon the project’s completion.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>Demonstration</code> - A demonstration of controller features for future reference is also required. Any user, regardless of technical background, should have at least a basic understanding on how to use the device from the recorded demonstration(s).
            </p>

            <h6>Design Considerations:</h6>  
            <p>
                <code>Circuit</code>:<br>

            <br>
            <p>
                <code>Cylinder</code>:<br>
                The system was built using components from the MRI-Compatible Tactile Stimulation Device created by Alex Hay. The actuator was designed loosely based off of the air cylinder designs of iPolymer, in collaboration with experts at Northwestern’s Segal Prototyping and Fabrication Lab.
            </p>
            <p>
                Numerous materials were initially considered for the mechanical design, including PTFE (Teflon), Delrin/Acetal, HDPE, and nylon. PTFE was chosen as the cylinder material for its natural slipperiness, machinability, and desirable results in materials testing, as previously conducted by Professor Netta Gurari. The cylinder features two chambers to push the enclosed piston up and down the length of the cylinder. The barrel was machined and tapped first using a conversational mill, with calculated dimensions inspired by the iPolymer design.
            </p>
            <p>
                The resulting dimensions can be viewed in the part drawings included in the appendix. In the current design, the two holes are offset by a little less than 90º to ensure that the connectors do not interfere with each other due to the cylinder’s short length.
            </p>

            </small>

            <p>
                <code>Software</code>:<br>
                It was decided to move away from hardware-based controls to limit potential mechanical failures and costs as much as possible, but also to keep the controls and any necessary visualization in one place.
                This resulted in the addition of fully automatable execution and a friendly Python UI to collect, visualize, and store data.

            <h6>Challenges and Solutions:</h6>
            <p>
                As with any mechatronics project, there were a good deal of challenges along the way. However the two most significant were the mechatronics troubleshooting of real-life systems, and the search for undocumented product information.<br><br>
                <code>Troubleshooting challenge</code>:<br>
                A significant amount of time was spent attempting to debug all different iterations of the board. Many hours were spent desoldering and resoldering components just to be sure they worked.<br>
                <small>(Protip: please just make your own footprints for your PCB design!)</small><br>
                Unfortunately, two L4931 voltage regulators did not make it through this quarter.<br>

                <code>Documentation challenge</code>:<br>
                While purchasing copies of more well-known branded items helped to trim down the budget, such products don't always come equipped with full documentation. The most difficult of these challenges was with the replacement pressure regulator, as some crucial information was left off of the included datasheet.

                Note: additional documentation recording tips, tricks, and supplemental information learned throughout the course of this project are included with the manual in the git repo.

                <code>Future work</code>:<br>
                For the future, a thorough characterization of the forces applied by the cylinder onto the fingertip would be ideal to ensure a reliable, controlled force for every trial. Using a hand interface to mount the cylinder would help to standardize the distribution, and it would also keep the cylinder stationary.<br>
                <br>The ability to control the airflow through the top opening of the cylinder could also help to maintain a more stable pressure value. While it may not have a significant effect on the study, adding an additional pressure sensor to measure the pressure at retraction could complement the pressure readings at extension (when the piston is exposed). Such measurements could also tell us what amount of force is necessary to force the cylinder into a retracted position while airflow is directed to the bottom chamber without requiring the test subject to overexert themself. Instead, the collected data could be used to determine an output pressure that would be challenging enough for the test subject to oppose without the concern of any harm.<br>
                <br>Finally, additional sensing could be added to expand the measured data from each trial. Types of sensors that come to mind are a force sensor and a position sensor to further characterize the tactile stimulus provided. These sensors could also aid in the standardization of the setup, as previously mentioned with the hand interface. As mentioned in the previous iteration of this project, knowing if and when the piston engages with the finger is also important information, especially as pressure data is being logged in real time. To collect this data, a conductive and MRI-compatible material, such as aluminum foil, which is non-ferromagnetic, could serve as a capacitance sensor and safely be implemented to determine the exact moment of contact.
